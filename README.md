[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5a0e3da5-05bc-4f0f-ab9f-0f51d761a8e6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/quizzical-wiles-4eb494/deploys)

This is a tool to help build color palettes that conform with WCAG 2.0 standards.
For more information, refer to [Success Criterion 1.4.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html).

It is a fork of [toolness/accessible-color-matrix](https://github.com/toolness/accessible-color-matrix), which in turn was based on work done in: [18F/brand](https://github.com/18F/brand/pull/94).
The purpose for this fork is to reflect the international WCAG standard instead of an US-centric one.

## Quick Start
